# Refactor-Code
Refactoring code assignment for trilogy coding bootcamp

For this assignment I was asked to refactor code to meet accessibility requierments and to clean up the html and css files.
I added semantic HTML5 tags to improve accessibility.  This meant changing the nav styles which proved diffucult at first.
I also drastically reduced the CSS by combining not only like styles, but also by combining classes in the HTML.
